Q. Give some idea on what is a Data type. What are Primitive Data types and Non-Primitive Data types. Explain with some examples.
Data type:
A data type determines the type of data a variable can hold. 
JavaScript has two main categories of data types:
1. Primitive Data Types
2. Non-Primitive Data Types

1. Primitive Data Types
Definition: These are basic, predefined data types that store a single value.
Characteristics:
-Stored by value.
-Immutable (cannot be altered after creation, but the variable can be reassigned).
-Default types provided by JavaScript.
Examples of Primitive Types:

1.String:

-Stores sequences of characters enclosed in "", '', or backticks (``).
Ex:
let name = "John";  
console.log(typeof name);

2. Number

-Stores all numeric data types (integers, floats, etc.).
Ex:
let age = 25; 
let price = 99.99; 
console.log(typeof age);

3.Boolean:

-Represents true or false values.
-Used for conditional statements.
Ex:
let isAdmin = true;

4.Undefined:

-A variable that has been declared but not initialized.
Ex:
let a;
console.log(a); 
console.log(typeof a); 

5.Null:

-Represents the intentional absence of any object value. Often used to reset a variable.
Ex:
let b = null;
console.log(b);


2. Non-Primitive Data Types
Definition: These are complex data types that can store multiple values or complex objects.
Characteristics:
-Stored by reference (the variable stores a reference to the memory location where the value is stored).
-Mutable (values can be changed after creation).
-User-defined.

Examples of Non-Primitive Types:

1.Array:

-Stores a list of values, accessed by their index.
Ex:
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
console.log(typeof fruits);

2.Function:
-A reusable block of code.
Ex:
function greet() {
    return "Hello!";
}
console.log(typeof greet);

3.Object:
-A collection of key-value pairs.
Ex:
let person = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 25}
console.log(typeof person);
